# Web-based tool for automatic color adjustment based on CIECAM02-m2
In this work, we present a web-based tool that automatically adjusts the color of a user interface element, based on the change of background color, in order to preserve its color appearance. The presented tool supports different versions of CIECAM model and is build as single-page-application (SPA). To check the performance of the color adjustment and usefulness of the tool, the user can view colors in three different preview modes and change parameters of the selected CIECAM model. The user can also add colors to the palette and export their numeric values in different formats for further usage. Besides its primary practical usage, the tool also has an educational purpose, since the user can see how changing the background, affects the color appearance of an element and how CIECAM02-m2 model can be used to adjust the element’s color in order to maintain color appearance.
